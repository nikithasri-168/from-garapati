Here’s nothing better than cuddling up with a good book. Books inherently offer solitude and a temporary escape from your own story. They’re basically magic. Avid readers usually have a long history with books that often either started in the womb or shortly after — thanks to parents and their incessant desire to enrich your brain. So it’s no surprise that you are at your happiest when you’re reading.

>This Node.js code snippet creates a simple Node.js HTTP server that writes a response to the client and listens on port 8080. If it is running, a message will be logged stating "server running on port 8080".
```
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((request, response) => {

	response.writeHead(200, {
		'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
	});
	response.write('Hello from Pieces!');
	response.end();

}).listen(8080);

console.log('server running on port 8080');
